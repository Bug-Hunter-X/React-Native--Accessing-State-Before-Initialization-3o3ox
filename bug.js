This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when using the useState hook in React Native before the component has mounted or if you are trying to access it within a function before React has re-rendered the component.

Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    // Error: count might be undefined here!
    console.log(count * 2); // Trying to access count before it's set
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted!');
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
